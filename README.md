## Overview
Noise synthesis is a promising solution for addressing the data shortage problem in data-driven low-light RAW image denoising. However, accurate noise synthesis methods often necessitate labor-intensive calibration and profiling procedures during preparation, preventing them from landing to practice at scale. This work introduces a practically simple noise synthesis pipeline based on detailed analyses of noise properties and extensive justification of widespread techniques. Compared to other approaches, our proposed pipeline eliminates the cumbersome system gain calibration and signal-independent noise profiling steps, reducing the preparation time for noise synthesis from days to hours. Meanwhile, our method exhibits strong denoising performance, showing an up to $0.54\mathrm{dB}$ PSNR improvement over the current state-of-the-art noise synthesis technique.

## Installation
Clone the repository and install necessary dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## MEY-AN00 phone DNG workflow

This workspace also contains a sensor-specific HONOR MEY-AN00 packed-DNG pipeline.  It keeps `raw-test/val` as independent-scene **synthetic-only** validation and `raw-test/noisy` as unpaired qualitative input, so neither is misreported as real paired PSNR.  See [TRAINING_MEY_AN00.md](TRAINING_MEY_AN00.md) for manifest/calibration, training, checkpoint evaluation, qualitative inference, and the future registered noisy-clean pair protocol.

For the capacity-control experiment comparing the existing NAFNet-Tiny with
the SID-pretrained U-Net and the standard/original NAFNet, see
[TRAINING_LARGE_MODELS.md](TRAINING_LARGE_MODELS.md).


## Test our pretrained model
**We follow [PMN](https://github.com/megvii-research/PMN/tree/TPAMI) for dataset preparation**

**STEP 1: Download datasets and processing them:**

* [ELD (11.46 GB)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13Ge6-FY9RMPrvGiPvw7O4KS3LNfUXqEX/view?usp=sharing), [SID (25 GB)](https://storage.googleapis.com/isl-datasets/SID/Sony.zip), [LRID (523 GB)](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1fXlb-Q_ofHOtVOufe5cwDg?pwd=vmcl)

* Use `get_dataset_infos.py` to generate evaluation dataset infos (please modify `--root_dir` to anchor the dataset location). This script will generate dataset info to the `infos` folder.
```bash 
# Evaluate
python3 get_dataset_infos.py --dstname ELD --root_dir /data/ELD --mode SonyA7S2
python3 get_dataset_infos.py --dstname SID --root_dir /data/SID/Sony --mode evaltest
python3 get_dataset_infos.py --dstname LRID --root_dir /data/LRID
```

**STEP 2: Download necessary files:**
* Download [pretrained checkpoints](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KyR9f6SIciXWv29owm0xYPCOnaMd9YWh?usp=sharing) and put them into the `checkpoints` folder.
* Download [pre-computed dark shadings](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18YUiNsSH-YR9L5KJZGP23-DsOvJC0JWz?usp=sharing) and put them into the `resources` folder.


**STEP 3: Run the evaluation:**
```bash 
# SID and ELD datasets (SonyA7S2 DSLR)
python3 test_denoise_sideld.py
# LRID dataset (Redmi smartphone)
python3 test_denoise_lrid.py 
```
